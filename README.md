# Inemuri - Sleep Soundly on Public Transport

Inemuri is a mobile app prototype inspired by the Japanese art of napping anywhere. It is designed to help users sleep soundly on public transport without missing their stop. By setting their destination on the map, users can nap with confidence, receiving gentle vibrations and alarmswhen it's time to disembark.

## Key Features

- **Map-based Destination Setting**: Users can easily select their intended stop using an interactive map powered by Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library.
- **GPS-enabled Proximity Alerts**: Automatic notifications are provided as users approach their destination, thanks to the Geolocation API.
- **Vibration Patterns**: Users receive gentle vibrations as they approach their destination, ensuring they wake up on time.

## Functionalities Added

- **Favorite Locations**: Users can save their home and work locations as favorite destinations for easy access.
- **Current Location Tracking**: The app tracks the user's current location.
- **Proximity Alerts**: Alerts users when they are nearing their destination.
- **Zoom Control**: Allows users to adjust the map's zoom level for better visibility.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Provides an option to toggle between light and dark modes for better viewing in different environments.
- **Sharing Location**: Enables users to share their current location with others.
- **Center Options**: If you click any direction box the map view will be set for that.

## Technology Stack

- **[Leaflet]([url](https://leafletjs.com))**: Used for map visualization.
- **Geolocation API**: Provides GPS access for proximity alerts.
