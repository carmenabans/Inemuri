# Inemuri

Inemuri, inspired by the Japanese art of napping anywhere, is a mobile app prototype designed to help you **sleep soundly on public transport without missing your stop**. Set your destination on the map, drift off peacefully, and receive gentle vibrations when it's time to disembark. Never miss your stop again - nap with confidence!


## Key Features
- **Map-based Destination Setting**: Select your intended stop easily using an interactive map powered by Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library.
- **GPS-enabled Proximity Alerts**: Rest assured with automatic notifications as you approach your destination, thanks to the Geolocation API.
- **Vibration Patterns**: Receive gentle vibrations as you approach your destination, ensuring you wake up on time.
